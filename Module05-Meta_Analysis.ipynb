    "Meta pathway analysis using multiple omics data is a rapidly emerging field in bioinformatics and systems biology that allows for the integration of diverse omics data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other molecular biology disciplines. By integrating multiple omics data, meta pathway analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cellular functions and molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes in a given organism. This approach offers a powerful means to investigate the complex interplay between genes, proteins, and metabolites in different biological contexts, such as disease states or environmental conditions. Moreover, meta pathway analysis can identify key regulatory pathways and molecular signatures that are critical for the development of targeted therapeutics and precision medicine. Overall, the integration of multiple omics data through meta pathway analysis has the potential to reveal new insights into the underlying biology of complex diseases and to guide the development of personalized treatments. In this submodule, we will demonstrate the power of meta-analysis to find the significant pathways for Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.\n",

    "In this submodule, we will install several libraries to perform enrichment analysis, meta-analysis and visualization. We will install package `fgsea` to perform enrichment analysis. For visualization purposes, we will use `ggpubr` and `cowplot`. `ggpubr` provides a range of functions that enable users to create publication-ready plots, including barplots, boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, and heatmaps. `cowplot` provides the ability to create custom layouts for complex multi-panel figures. The package includes functions for arranging plots in a grid, as well as for adding margins, padding, and labels. The package also includes features for aligning plots, adjusting font sizes and colors, and exporting plots to different file formats. To perform meta-analysis, we will use the `meta` R package which provides functions for conducting fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses, as well as for conducting sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression analyses. The package also provides tools for assessing the heterogeneity of the studies included in the analysis and for creating forest plots to visualize the results. Lastly, packages include `stringr` and `matrixStats` provide utility functions to manipulate input matrices. The package `fgsea` can be downloaded from Bioconductor while other packages can be installed from CRAN. The code to install all packages is presented below:"

    "## Enrichment Analysis using FGSEA\n",
    "In this section, we will perform enrichment analysis using the `fgsea` package for all methods.\n",
    "FGSEA is an extension of the widely used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method, which computes\n",
    "an enrichment score for each gene set by comparing the distribution of genes in the set with the\n",
    " distribution of all genes. FGSEA, on the other hand, uses a fast algorithm to estimate the p-value\n",
    " for each gene set, based on the empirical distribution of the enrichment score obtained by permuting\n",
    " the gene labels in the ranked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps in performing FGSEA are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rank the genes according to a certain metric, such as gene expression or differential expression.\n",
    "2. Define a set of genes of interest, such as a pathway or a gene ontology term.\n",
    "3. Compute the enrichment score for each gene set based on the ranks of its member genes in the ranked list.\n",
    "4. Generate a null distribution of enrichment scores by permuting the gene labels in the ranked list.\n",
    "5. Compute the p-value for each gene set by comparing its observed enrichment score with the null distribution.\n",
    "6. Correct for multiple testing, for example, by using the false discovery rate (FDR) or the Bonferroni method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the method `fgsea` we use 1,000 permutations and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to the ratio of differences\n",
    "of mean and standard deviation between control and disease groups.\n",
    "Now, we need to get the geneset and do parameter settings."

    "## Meta-Analysis\n",
    "In this section, we will perform a generic inverse variance meta-analysis using `metagen` function available in the `meta` package. `metagen` is a statistical method used in meta-analysis to combine the results of multiple studies that have measured the same effect size, typically using different sample sizes and study designs. This method involves pooling the effect sizes from each study, weighted by the inverse of their variance, in order to obtain an overall estimate of the effect size and its confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind the generic inverse variance meta-analysis is that studies with larger sample sizes, which tend to have smaller variance, should be given more weight in the meta-analysis than studies with smaller sample sizes, which tend to have larger variance. This is achieved by weighting each study's effect size estimate by the inverse of its variance, which is a measure of the precision of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generic inverse variance meta-analysis is often used in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials or observational studies, where the effect size is typically reported as a mean difference or a standardized mean difference between two groups, or as a hazard ratio or odds ratio for a binary outcome. This method assumes that the effect size estimates from each study are independent and normally distributed around the true effect size, and that there is no systematic bias or heterogeneity in the effect size estimates across studies."

    " In this course, we have successfully completed pathway analysis using omics data in five submodules that cover different aspects of bioinformatics analysis. The first submodule, Data Processing, introduces the fundamental concepts of preprocessing and quality control of microarray data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The second submodule, Differential Expression Analysis, focuses on how to analyze gene expression data to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more conditions. The third submodule, Gene Set and Pathway shows us how to use different R libraries to obtain pathways and GO terms with associated gene lists. The fourth submodule, Enrichment Analysis, focuses on the identification of enriched biological pathways or functional categories within a set of genes of interest. Finally, the fifth submodule, Meta Analysis, covers the techniques of meta-analysis which is a statistical approach to combine the results of multiple independent studies. Overall, the cloud learning module provides a comprehensive and practical guide for researchers to analyze and interpret their genomic data using various bioinformatics tools and techniques."
